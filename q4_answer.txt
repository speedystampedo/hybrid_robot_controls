The control system in this question can be assumed
to be a bang bang or on-off controller operating in a relay manner with a time delay. 
The system appears to asymptotically stable in the simulation as theta does appear converge to
to the zero value, the time delay added in this section now means that the system
can be simulated unlike the first rotation simulation.

The downside to this is that Zeno-like behaviour again develops, with continuous switching between control
input of -1 and 1. Asymptotic stability cannot be shown under close observation as the output fluctuates
between extremely small positive and negative numbers. This is not a montonically decreasing function
so it cannot have finite value as time goes to infinity.

This is not an infinite number of steps though clearly as the solver can now solve
the simulation. This is, however, 
extremely hard on the actuators and is behaviour that should be avoided.
