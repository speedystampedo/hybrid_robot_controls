The control system in this question can be assumed
to be a bang bang or on-off controller operating in a relay manner. 
Zeno behaviour is known as an infinite number of steps of a variable
within a finite amount of time and can often be difficult to control
within a hybrid system. 

When simulating a system with such a behaviour in Matlab
it will cause a lot of "chatter" or oscillation around the operating point,
which leads to the solver being unable to solve the system. This is observed
in this simulation at around 1 second and therefore the system cannot be observed
to be stable within the simulation.

Judging by the later questions, i.e. question 4, it is likely that the system
has an extremely small error oscillation around zero and is not asymptotically stable in theory.
In pratice this will be an extremely small value.
