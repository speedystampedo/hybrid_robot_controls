When implementing the controller, as per figure x, 
performance was only reasonable if using a gain value around x% less
than specified in Task 9, see figure y. The controller was unstable if using
the values specified in Task 9. This was only for the case of starting at some x
and y values and moving to a reference value though, which is a different case
as compared to the c robot simulator.

When using the c code version of this algorithm in the robot simulator
it was found that the robot does not move, which makes sense considering it is starting
at x0 and y0 and the aim of this part of the controller is to not let the
robot move from its x and y coordinates when it is rotating.
