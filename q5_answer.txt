The control system in this question can be assumed
to be a bang bang or on-off controller operating in a relay manner with a time delay
and also a zero order hold representing sampling of the system. 
The system is not asymptotically stable in that there is continued oscillation
at a fixed amplitude and frequency of theta but it appears to be stable.

This system does at least avoid the extremely quick oscillation of the control
signal that was observed in previous simulations. Now the control signal only
changes at the frequency of the sampler, i.e. the ZOH module.

Unlike the previous question the frequency of the control signal oscillation
does not increase, which was certainly a problem that could be observed.
