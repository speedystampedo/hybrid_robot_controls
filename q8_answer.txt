When implementing the controller, as per figure x, 
performance was only reasonable if using a gain value around 50x less
than specified in Task 7, see figure y. The controller was unstable if using
the values specified in Task 8 and up to around 5x less, as you can see in 
figure z.

This is likely a missing conversion factor at this point in time, however,
it is also perfectly normal for the maximum theoretical value of gain
to not be completely accurate when it comes to simulation of the system.

When using the c code version of this algorithm in the robot simulator
it was found that oscillation would occur using the calculated values. Adding
a conversion factor of 1/100 gave reasonable performance, showing that the
Matlab simulation gave the valuable insight that a conversion factor was
required.
